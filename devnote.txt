Future Note here:
I really regret not having the start date of this file
written down. However, I am 99% sure that it started on
last Sunday (08/06/2025). Just taking this as a note.

Future Note 3 (30/07/2025, 11:38):
I am going to go traveling tomorrow, so don't expect
much of Farmbotany. I am the one that carys the entire
project, and no one else is even thankfull. They are
way too focused on the idea and forget the execution.
The optimizations were really good, but it still
doesen't run flawlessly.

Note 4 (01/08/2025, 18:32):
Hi! Me here from in the travel. It's been going OK
but far from icredible. I've got little to no time
to program so the progress is and is going to be
really slow. That's it!

Note 5 (02/08/2025, 09:21):
I started writing this everyday. This is basicly
my diary lol. So, this time i started adding
keyboard integration. I higly appreciate when
i can only use the keyboard. That's pretty much
my workflow. I wasen't able to do much again,
because i am traveling. Good luck for me!

Note 6 (04/08/2025, 14:00):
Got home from the travel yesterday. Now i am pretty
sure that i am can consistenly deliver commits. I am
glad that everything went OK. Working on the ui has
been a nightmare, and i really hope i can get over
this as quickly as possible. Good luck for me!
